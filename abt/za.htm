<p>There are three versions of this character. The original, from a private pokefanfic that I never finished; The main one, that lives in my conworld; and the version as a fancharacter for Yokoka's Quest. The information in the table is based on the main version.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Original</b> - has never been drawn once.<br>An alolan vulpix that ran away from her trainer a long time ago. Found a small community to settle in.<br>Some years later, while she was out in the woods gathering food, a suspicious Pachirisu demanded a portion of it. Zata denied it any, and was blast with a move she'd never seen before. She was blown out the forest and lain in the middle of the street, nearly immobile. The other pokemon in the community rushed Zata to the minccino, and she was quickly taken care of.<br>Zata recovered quickly, but a dark blue scar remained on her chest for about nine years.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Main</b></p>
<img src="../img/zaa.png" style="width:62.5%"><br>
<p>A shitoka who lives in one of the old towers near Sanora. It's not known where she comes from, but this is where she stays as of right now.<br>She has a ??? that sometimes messes with her thoughts, but it's never strong enough to take full control.<br><br>Zata likes consistency, and for the things around her to be consistent as well. A major shift in methods she can deal with easily, but a minor inconsistency could bug her for a bit. Rarely would she be irritated any longer than this, though.<br>Despite her love of consistency, Zata likes music and would love learning to play an instrument.<br><br>Zata doesn't like to talk much, but she will make an effort to do so. However, she seems to have a lot of thoughts and ideas she can't express...</p>
