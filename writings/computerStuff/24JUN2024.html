    <h4>my thoughts on easyOS.</h4>
    <p>i got easyOS to run from a USB. it's a hassle to set up, the session information is never actually saved to the drive, but it actually feels nice to use.<br>
    i'd say easyOS is on par with linuxMint tbh. it certainly feels <i>different</i> but not any better or worse. it's just the setup process and inability to save.<br>
    the reason im using a USB btw is bc i don't just have an empty hardDrive laying around. i could just wipe one of the drives though - i don't have anything important.</p>

    <p>can't amend without merge conflicts. too many minor edits makes you look stupid. either do all your contributions in one go or be made fun of.<br>
    "git pull" to a localHost and push from there? nope - you need a gpg key so long you can't possibly remember it, and it's a hassle to find, and idek if it works yet.<br>
    they disabled password login in 2021 because it's "insecure". (stop giving out your passwords lol (im aware of hackers but that's a risk you take simply by being on the internet))</p>
