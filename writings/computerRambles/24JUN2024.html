    <h4>my thoughts on easyOS.</h4>
    <sub>24JUN2024</sub>
    <p>i got easyOS to run from a USB. it's a hassle to set up, the session information is never actually saved to the drive, but it actually feels nice to use.<br>
    i'd say easyOS is on par with linuxMint tbh. it certainly feels <i>different</i> but not any better or worse. it's just the setup process and inability to save.<br>
    the reason im using a USB btw is bc i don't just have an empty hardDrive laying around. i could just wipe one of the drives though - i don't have anything important.</p>
