 <summary>Srocosmu</summary>
 <p>A mile-wide portal that connects Earth and Znebo. It floats just under mile above the north pole and it is sustained by machines built by an unknown race.</p>
 </details>
 <hr>
 <details>
 <summary title="singular: Zune">Zunej</summary>
 <p>An animal that came from the other side of the portal. Their outer appearance would lead you to believe they are simply "furries", but they are actually magical in nature. They are made of a substance called "Inaci". They also have the ability to use something called "Srotsi".</p>
 </details>
 <details>
 <summary>Inaci</summary>
 <p>Inaci is a crystalline gel that fully liquifies at temperatures above 59F and completely solidifies at temperatures below -10F [give~take 10F]. It can manipulate itself when imbued with Srotsi, as though it were alive. Animals made of this substance are called <span title="singular: Aci">"Acaj"*</span> by the Zunej.</p>
 </details>
 <details>
 <summary>Srotsi</summary>
  <p>All Acaj and <span title="fluffy animals are simply defined as furred (or feathered) animals that have not been poisoned by Naya.">fluffy*</span> animals have access to an aura called Srotsi. It may either be physical or enhance one’s abilities, and its limits/rules are only defined by the user’s mind and their innate Srotsari Potential.</p>
 <p>The Srotsari Potential of an Aci or fluffy animal is divided into four levels of potential destruction to the environment surrounding them:</p>
  <ul>
 <li>SR-I - Low to none.</li>
 <li>SR-II - Low to moderate.</li>
 <li>SR-III - Moderate to high.</li>
 <li>SR-IV - High to extreme.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Exposure to this magic in any form incites transfurmation in non-fluffy animals. It can be stopped midway through by one's sheer willpower, but never undone.<br>The transfurmation can be partial, but it will always be at least half of the body.<br>Srotsi can be contained within objects and converted to and from any other types of energy. </p>
 </details>

 <details>
 <summary>Nagya, Naya</summary>
 <p>An electrically charged form of petroleum the penguins use in their expirements on humans and other animals. It will cause forced transformation on any maelu animal affected by it, fluffy or not.<br>An Aci will slowly lose all its Srotsi [and therefore its life] upon making contact with it. [the process is very slow, but there's no known way to stop it]<br>A maelu animal affected by it <i>is</i> able to change their form to whatever they want, though there is typically a time-limit at which they must return to their "stable form", or a condition that must be met before transformation can take place.</p>

<h3>[begin]</h3>
<p>Everything on Lanpo [Earth] that happened upto mid-2020 IRL is unchanged. But a portal appeared in the sky of the north pole suddenly, and strange animals emerged from it. They landed on the ice unharmed, despite their apparent crystalline structure. Scientists were quick to try and SCP the animals, but word of their existence somehow got to the public. These animals, they were similar to ours, but more.. human. Anthropomorphic animals \ or "furries", as they would be called by the public. Not that many people really cared, since it was a minor issue what to do about them. More serious things were going on at the time. Did you <i>see</i> 2020?<br><br>When the furries came to earth, however, they also brought with them the ability to use magic. It was instantly granted to all animals the moment the portal opened. But those poisoned by petroleum, they would not be able to use this power without transforming akin to the furries.<br>Penguins used their magic to operate the abandoned technology, and they did countless experiments on various animals. We'll get back to them later, since I'm explaining in chronological order.<br><br>It was found that simply being exposed to active magic could incite transfurmation in a human. This is where things might go awry. "Does my dog/cat/[pet] secretly want to transfur me?" | No, it probably doesn't. It just discovered a new ability and is trying it on everything it sees. "Is this new <i>transfurmation</i> thing an effect of the virus?" | Uh, no.<br><br>Yeah you could probably see people getting onto wild theories. The nations were doing their normal stuff, but things haven't deviated <i>too</i> much yet. Or maybe they have, I can't be sure.</p>
<hr>
<p>The furries are still contained in the scientific facilities. Researchers have managed to learn a bit about them.<br>The furries call themselves the "Zunej". Zunej are made of a crystalline gel they call "Inaci", which freezes/melts at 15C [59F]. In its liquid state, the gel behaves like a living animal, despite the lack of any biological cells. The only explanation is that the Zunej are kept alive by the magic they call "Srotsi", and this assumption would be correct.<br><br>Meanwhile, penguins have figured out that exposing an animal to electrically charged petroleum can transform said animal into any combination of multiple others. There's a method the penguins found to predetermine a few basic outcomes, but most of the time they just leave everything up to chance.<br>[As someone suggested on discord, perhaps this effect <i>can</i> work more than once? The penguins never tested it though, so we'll never know unless humans can somehow manage to recreate it.]</p>
<p>Note // TF through Srotsi can be stopped midway, by one's own willpower. TF through the special oil called "Naya" cannot be stopped at all until it is complete.</p>
<hr>
<p>People would've probably been trying to kill the Zunej, or stay far away from them. Animals can learn Srotsi too though, so some people went so far as to not have any pets. Some people who were affected just tried to live with it, some loved it, even. Some people may've thought that the transfurmation was a sort of "vaccine". They may be right, but a lot of people wanted to stay human.<br>"But furries?" Yeah what about them? Give them what they want. [they won't necessarily become their fursonas, but it'd unlikely for them to not, since the animal form is based on one's own desires.]<br><br>The Zunej were simply curious as to what was on the other side of the portal their strange technology had created, and they arrived here. Not all the Zunej were captured by scientists, and a few had managed to settle in the thick snow. The plants they were familiar with though, they were either rare or absent. On the other side of the portal, life seems to flourish despite the harsh cold there. It's still not truly known why, but most assume it's because of Srotsi.</p>
