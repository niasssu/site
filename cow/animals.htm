<center><h2>Maerx</h2></center>
<p>Maerx are a type of animal native to.. practically every planet that can bear this type of life. They are made of cellar structures, and all your familiar animals fit under this umbrella. Alongwith these, there are a few aliens that are suspiciously simiar to the ones you are familiar with.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Maerx, The species for which the type is named, as they are the most advanced therein.</li>
<li>Pfazakussa, Maelu animals akin to typical deer.</li>
<li>Romiqi, Mice that can manipulate electrical energy.</li>
<li>more to be determined...</li>

<center><h2>Lanarifsaj</h2></center>
<p>Lanarifsaj are hybrids between Maerx and Acaj. Maerx can be born as Lanarifsaj [as is the case for Ayaxli], or transformed into them via moderate exposure to Srotsi. A Mae who fully succumbs to the effects of Srotsari Transformation will become an Aci though.</p>

<h2 style="color:#aaa"><center>Nagyalu Transformations</center></h2>
<p style="color:#aaa">Something only penguins have managed to successfully create. They're a type of Lanarifs that has the ability to change its form at will. They can imitate almost any material, too.</p>

  <center><h2>Acaj</h2></center><p>Acaj are a type of animal native to Znebo. All Acaj are consistent of the crystalline gel called "Inaci". Their life is sustained by Srotsi, and they can manipulate it akin to an aura.<br><br>
  The substance that Acaj are made from melts at temperatures above 59F and completely crystallizes below -10F. An Aci can survive at temperatures within &plusmn;10F of this range, but upon surpassing the margin, they cannot be restored to life.<br>Acaj lack Maelu structures like bones or organs, and are essentially gelatinous. Their outside is crystalline and solid, but their inside is nearly liquid.<br>The base colour of Inaci (and therefore acari skin) is a translucent gray. It could change if there are chemical impurities though.<br><br>Acaj tend to be crepescular, though some lean fully into nocturnalism. There are few diurnal Acaj.<br>Acaj are omninvorous, but most prefer fruits.</p>
<hr>
<p>Acaj are divided into several "classes":<ul>
<li>Zunej - those that appear akin to common mammals, but have human-like stature and intelligence.</li>
<li>Tkai - those that appear similar to avians.</li>
<li>Ritalqaj - those that appear akin to reptiles.</li>
<li>And any that don't fit into the above categories are simply called "Acaj".
</ul></p>
<hr>
<p>Acaj <i>technically</i> do not have distinct sexes, but due to the prescence of Maerx on their world, they do have concepts of male and female.</p>

<h2>Ayaxli</h2>
<p>The Ayaxli are a hybrid made from both Acari and Maelu traits. They are mostly Acari, and are therefore classified as an Aci by the <span title="northern human science federation">NHSF*</span>.<br>Ayaxli appear similar to humans with rodential traits, and they behave closer to their rodential counterparts.<br><br>Ayaxli are not divided into any [official] qcur.<br><br>Ayaxlari reproduction is Maelu, the same as humans and other mammals.</p>
</div>
<div style="width:95%; background-image:linear-gradient(to right, #eac, #fff); border-left:2px solid #f00; margin:5px; padding:5px;">
<h2>Maerx</h2>
<p>The Maerx are a Type II civilization in... a galaxy, and they are the most abundant and advanced species therein. They resemble humans quite a lot, even down to the biology.<br>Maerx have features akin to other mammalian animals, and they try to face everything logically (even though they cannot). They do not have much societal division besides male and female, and they reproduce the same way humans do.<br><br>A simpler way to describe their appearance would be "kemonomimi".</p>
</div>
<div style="width:95%; background-image:linear-gradient(to right, #eac, #fff); border-left:2px solid #f00; margin:5px; padding:5px;">
<h2>Pfazakussa</h2>
<p>Pfazakussa are basically deer with thicker fur and the ability to speak. They speak the same language as the Maerx &mdash; Maelu.<br>They do not have much civilization or organization, but they're getting there.</p>
</div>
<div style="width:95%; background-image:linear-gradient(to right, #ace, #fff); border-left:2px solid #00f; margin:5px; padding:5px;">
<h2>Ritalqaj</h2>
<p>A class of Acaj akin to reptiles. They are quadrupedal and most are akin to the lizard variety. They are simple creatures.<br><br>Ritalqaj may be divided into three qcur depending on the element they emanate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iscritalqaj - fire</li>
<li>Mwaritalqaj - liquid (of any kind)</li>
<li>Safritalqaj - (plant) life</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="width:95%; background-image:linear-gradient(to right, #eac, #fff); border-left:2px solid #f00; margin:5px; padding:5px;">
<h2>Romiqi</h2>
<p>Romiqi are a type of mouse native to Doribrayon that can manipulate electrical energy. They swim in swarms that can change shape akin to newly-born Acaj.<br>An individual Romiqi is quite weak though, its electrical output at one time is about the same as a static shock from your doorknob. But it regenerates its energy very quickly, even without food.</p>
</div>
<div style="width:95%; background-image:linear-gradient(to right, #ace, #fff); border-left:2px solid #00f; margin:5px; padding:5px;">
<h2>Tkai</h2>
<p>A common class of Acaj on Znebo. They are intelligent avians that live in tight-knit communities in Znebori forests. They have a freindly relationship with the Zunej.<br>Tkari feathers are normally monochrome per individual, though the hue may be any colour on the visible spectrum. Some Tkai may have more colours.<br><br>Tkai only have two qcur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tkai</li>
<li>Rotkai</li>
</ul>
<p>The class system for who counts as which is not clear.</p>

<div style="width:95%; background-image:linear-gradient(to right, #ace, #fff); border-left:2px solid #00f; margin:5px; padding:5px;">
<h2>Zunej</h2>
<p>The most common class of Acaj on Znebo, the one for which the planet is named. They are bipedal [though most can walk on all fours if they choose to] and have features similar to Maelu mammals. They are highly intelligent, perhaps just as much as humans. They have many languages, the most common being Nezai.<br>Zuneri fur is typically monochrome per individual, with a white or pink underbelly. The hue may be anywhere on the visible spectrum, and some Zunej may have more colours.<br><br>Zunej are split further into groups called "qcur" which each have an "amenara" for themselves. Some common ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sacaj - vulpine traits</li>
<li>Esmaj - feline traits</li>
<li>Anuj - canine traits</li>
<li>Nalsoj - ursine traits</li>
<li>Haluj - lagomorphic traits</li>
<li><strike title="this term is reserved for something else">Nalkaj - equestrian traits</strike>*</li>
<li>Panaj - (typically vulpine) those that choose to walk on all fours most of the time <span title="panaj are sometimes considered separate from zunej due to their stature, but they are just as intelligent and participate in society like the rest of them."><sup>hovernote</sup></span></li>
<li>Shitokaj - (typically vulpine) those that can manipulate the temperature around them to a minor degree</li>
</ul>
<p>Most qcur tend to get along.<br><br>Humans commonly refer to Zunej as "furries", due to their <i>suspicious</i> resemblance to anthropomorphic animals.</p>
